    "2)Usefulness of multiprocessing in Python:\n",
    "Multiprocessing in Python is useful for achieving parallelism, improving performance, utilizing system resources efficiently, and building scalable and robust applications. It allows for concurrent execution of tasks in separate processes, taking advantage of multi-core CPUs and distributed computing environments. By running tasks in parallel, multiprocessing can significantly reduce processing time, especially for CPU-bound tasks. It provides a simple programming model and helps in better resource utilization, stability, and scalability of applications."

    "Ans:---\n",
    "The differences between multiprocessing and multithreading are:--\n",
    "1)a)Multiprocessing involves running multiple processes simultaneously, each with its own memory space. It provides true parallelism and is suitable for CPU-bound tasks. Communication between processes requires explicit mechanisms like pipes or queues.\n",
    "1)b)Multithreading involves running multiple threads within a single process, sharing the same memory space. Threads are lighter-weight and useful for concurrent I/O-bound tasks. Communication between threads is simpler since they can directly access shared data.\n",
    "2)Multiprocessing provides better fault isolation, while a crash in one thread can affect the entire process in multithreading.\n",
    "3)Multiprocessing can be more complex due to managing processes and explicit synchronization, whereas multithreading is generally considered simpler but requires careful synchronization to avoid race conditions."
